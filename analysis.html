         <h3>Box Office Analysis</h3>
         <p>
            This project looks at the performance of films and distributors at the US Box Office using the top 10 highest performing
            movies for every year, from 2000 to the current year. This is updated every year and
            utilises data collected from <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/" target="_blank" class="hyper-link">Box Office Mojo</a>. You can find the full project write-up on my
             <a href="https://github.com/WillsFilms/US-Top10-boxoffice" target="_blank" class="hyper-link">GitHub</a>.

         <h3>Film Performance Predictor</h3>
         <p>
            This project looks to build models that can predict the performance of a movie based on
            it's components and factors (budget, director, genre etc.) using a multiple linear regression analysis.
        </p>

            <p>
                I am also developing a Monte Carlo simulation model on similar grounds.

         <h3>Turkish Airlines pdf processing</h3>
         <p>
            This project took a pdf file from Turkish Airlines that had information related to films
            available on flights and turned it into a format that could be analysed. The project utilised the fantastic and powerful 
            tool <span class="code-like">Power Query</span> within PowerBI. This project, files and write-up can be 
            found on my <a href="https://github.com/WillsFilms/Turkish-Airlines" target="_blank" class="hyper-link">GitHub</a>.

         <h3>Oscars Analyses</h3>
         <p>
            I have performed a number of analyses to do with the biggest awards ceremony in history - <strong>The 
                Academy Awards</strong>.
         </p>

         <p>
            The first analysis looks at the ages of winners of the Best Actor and Best Actress awards.

         <h3>Streaming Analysis</h3>
         <p>
            This project examines the trends within the major streaming services (Netflix, Amazon Prime, Disney+, Paramount+, Max and Hulu) to see how they have changed over time.
         </p>
         <p>
            You can find the project on my <a href="https://github.com/WillsFilms/Streaming-Analysis" target="_blank" class="hyper-link">GitHub</a>.

         <h3>Sean Bean Deaths in Film Analysis</h3>
         <p>
            This was a fun analysis project I performed to examine the truth behind the feeling that Sean Bean's characters seem to die in 
            every film he is in. To do this, I first collected data on every film that Sean Bean has starred in. This included the name of the film,
            the year of release, genre, whether the character died or not (1 for yes, 0 for no), and the cause of death. From this I calculated the death
            rate by genre, the number of films vs. number of deaths over time, as well as general summary statistics. 
         </p>
         <p>
            This was all performed and plotted using Excel. You can find the dataset here and click on the images below to explore the findings!
